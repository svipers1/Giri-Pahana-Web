    <center><h1>Welcome To Giripahana WebSite</h1></center>
    <center><p>We are delighted to welcome you to Giripahana.lk, the official digital platform designed especially for the teachers and students of Nagaragiriya Maha Vidyalaya. This website is being created and continuously improved by Silent Vipers, with the vision of making education, communication, and school management more efficient, accessible, and engaging for everyone in our school community.<br><br>

Here, teachers have the convenience of easily accessing their personal and class timetables, uploading assignments, sharing important announcements, and managing academic events all in one place. It is a hassle-free solution that reduces paperwork, saves time, and ensures that information reaches everyone quickly. Students, on the other hand, can log in to find their class schedules, download assignments, submit their work online, and stay updated with the latest school activities.<br><br>

In addition to academic resources, Giripahana.lk also keeps you informed about upcoming events, special notices, and important dates through the Event Calendar and Notification sections. Whether it’s a sports meet, a cultural program, or an exam date, you’ll never miss out on what’s happening at school.<br><br>

Our aim is to create a user-friendly, secure, and attractive online hub that brings teachers, students, and the school administration closer together. This platform will continue to grow with more features such as study resources, past papers, discussion forums, and interactive learning tools.<br><br>

We truly believe that with Giripahana.lk, learning and communication will be more fun, effective, and future-ready. This is just the beginning — together, we can build an inspiring digital environment for our school community..

    <center><h1>About Our Team-Silent Vipers</h1></center>
    <center><p>Silent Vipers is a passionate and creative programming team formed by four young tech enthusiasts with a shared dream — to bring innovation and digital solutions to life. Our team is made up of four members: three Sinhala members and one Muslim leader who guides the team with vision and determination. Even though we all come from different cultural backgrounds, our friendship, teamwork, and dedication make us stronger together.<br><br>

We are all Grade 11 students, currently learning and exploring new knowledge every day. While balancing school studies, we work on exciting projects such as web development, creative design, and educational software for our school and community. Our team thrives on challenges, whether it’s solving coding problems, designing user-friendly websites, or creating tools that make learning easier.<br><br>

Silent Vipers isn’t just about programming — it’s about team spirit, problem-solving, and continuous growth. We believe in sharing our skills with others, supporting each other, and learning together as one family. Our goal is to inspire other students to explore technology, think creatively, and never be afraid to innovate.<br><br>

We may be young, but with passion and teamwork, Silent Vipers is ready to strike with ideas that make a difference!
